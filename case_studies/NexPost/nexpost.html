      <summary class="collapsible-title">NexPost's Inspired Post Generation</summary>
      Social media is ubiquitous and affects both the personal and professional aspect of our lives. Content creators
      wish to post content on their social media accounts in order to generate reach and attract a bigger
      audience.<br />
      <br />
      <a href="https://www.nexpost.ai/" target="_blank">NexPost.ai</a> is an AI-powered social media content assistant
      that helps you create content posts across platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, and blogs. It
      leverages LLMs to generate social media posts content such as text and images. My friend Nia made it and it is
      great so check it out!
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary class="collapsible-title">Overview</summary>
        NexPost.ai's Inspired Post Generation feature allows users to generate new posts based on existing content,
        making it easier for them to share relevant and engaging content with their audience.
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary class="collapsible-title">Context and Background</summary>
        In today’s digital age, social media platforms are essential channels for both personal expression and
        professional outreach. With billions of daily users on LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, and blogs,
        creators face relentless pressure to publish fresh, engaging content that resonates with diverse
        audiences.<br />
        <br />
        Yet many content creators spend hours each week manually brainstorming, rewriting, and formatting posts to fit
        each platform’s unique conventions. This repetitive work leads to creative fatigue, inconsistent brand voice,
        and missed opportunities to leverage proven content.
        <br />
        We are all surrounded by powerful voices that we learn from and admire and the best content should survive. It
        is important to spread this content to more audiences so more people benefit.
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary class="collapsible-title">Problem Statement</summary>

        <h3>Current State</h3>
        Content creators admire powerful voices and want to share the best ideas with their own audiences, but they
        spend hours manually copying, paraphrasing, and reformatting others’ posts to fit LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram,
        Reddit, and blogs. This tedious process drains creativity, introduces inconsistency, and risks unintentional
        plagiarism.
        <h3>Desired Outcome</h3>
        Creators need an AI assistant that can ingest high-quality public content, rewrite it in their unique voice, and
        output platform-ready posts—so they can quickly amplify valuable ideas while maintaining authenticity and
        compliance.
        <h3>Gap & Impact</h3>
        Existing AI writing tools either generate generic copy from scratch or leave creators to handle all the manual
        paraphrasing themselves. As a result, valuable content remains siloed, creators face workflow bottlenecks, and
        audiences miss out on proven ideas presented in fresh, personalized ways.
        <h3>Full Statement</h3>
        Despite the abundance of inspiring social media content, there is no seamless, ethical system that automatically
        transforms admired posts into new, on-brand, platform-optimized content. Without such a solution, creators
        endure creative fatigue, inconsistent messaging, and missed opportunities to spread high-impact ideas to broader
        audiences.

    </details>
    <details>
      <summary class="collapsible-title">Goal</summary>
        We are building a feature to make it easier for users to generate posts so the main goal here is to drive higher
        activation and retention of NexPost.ai.
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary class="collapsible-title">Constraints</summary>
        Unlike other features of content generation in NexPost.ai where the content ideas stems from the user, this one
        is sourced from another author. This means it is difficult to assign responsibility for inappropriate content.
        NexPost.ai must flag a warning if the generated content may be deemed inappropriate or offensive.
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary class="collapsible-title">Customer segmentations</summary>
        There are several types of content creators that we could possibly target:

        <!-- TODO:  Should we be more targetted such as "Career Coach/ResumeBuilder Brand Builder"??? -->
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Personal Brand Builders</i><br />
            These are the users that want to build up their following in order to become influencers in their respective
            fields. They may be looking to build up their personal brand in order to attract job offers, consulting
            gigs, or speaking engagements.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Business Promoters</i><br />
            These are the users that want to promote their business or products. They may be looking to drive traffic to
            their website or online store in order to generate sales or other platforms such as YouTube to generate ad
            revenue.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Thought Leaders</i><br />
            These are the users that want to share their expertise and insights with their audience. They may be looking
            to establish themselves as thought leaders in their respective fields in order to attract consulting gigs,
            speaking engagements, or book deals.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Based on our goal of driving higher adoption and engagement amongst existing users, we would target the Personal
        Brand Builders. The reason for this is because they post frequently (low stakes, high volume) with types of
        content such as quick top of the mind thoughts or personal anecdotes. Comparatively, both the Business Promoters
        and Thought Leaders have more in depth content with higher stakes.

      <summary class="collapsible-title">Use Cases and Pain Points</summary>
        <!-- TODO:  Should we strip away a lot of the options to make this as simple as possible?  Less is more? -->
        <h3>Copy/Paste but Different</h3>
        The user wishes to, as quickly and as easily as possible, repost this to their audience but they do not want
        to be seen as somebody who copies other people's content without giving credit.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Pain Point</i><br />
            The user has to invest non-insignificant mental effort to think about how to change the content. This is
            especially true if the user is not a native speaker of the language of the post.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Writing style adaptation</h3>
        In this case, the user wishes to either change the content to match a specific writing style (perhaps their
        own to keep consistent branding or somebody else they admire like Shakespeare).
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Pain Point</i><br />
            The user has to invest non-insignificant mental effort to think about how to change the content. This is
            especially true if the user is not a native speaker of the language of the post.
          </li>
        </ul>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary class="collapsible-title">Prioritized Solutions</summary>
      All solutions will subject the input data for inappropriate content detection and will flag a warning if the generated content may be deemed inappropriate or offensive either globally or to a specific region or audience.
      <h3>Copy/Paste but Different</h3>
      NexPost.ai will generate a new post that conveys the same meaning but using slightly different words,
      different ordering, or presentation style (perhaps where the original content is in an ordered list and
      NexPost.ai will change the content to be prefixed by an emoji). If there is a critical point that is saved
      for last to keep the reader engaged (such as "read until the end for the best tip"), then that ordering will
      be preserved. Any emojis are subjected to be switched out and/or reordered as long as the meaning is
      preserved (such as steps that need to be taken chronologically).
      <h4>Priority 1</h4>
      The reason this is first is because this is the lowest effort scenario for the user. All they need to do
      is copy and paste the content.
      <h3>Writing style adaptation</h3>
      NexPost.ai will crawl through previous writing samples of the user (or perhaps another person that the user
      wishes to imitate) and regenerate the content in that same specific style to keep the branding consistent.
      For example, if the user is somebody who likes to rhyme a lot, then NexPost.ai will try to regenerate the
      content but make it rhyme.
      <h4>Priority 2</h4>
      The reason this is second is because this step requires a bit more effort from the user to supply
      examples of the writing style they wish to imitate and we want to offer the lowest barrier of entry
      solution first. This can be viewed as a feature-add later.
      <!--
    <h3>Content Modification</h3>
    In addition to the various customization (Writing Tone, Creativity Slider, Post Size slider, etc), NexPost.ai will allow the user to enter two pieces of information:  The original post and ther desired modification.  NexPost.ai will detect whether the two are in conflict with each other and will prompt the user to resolve the conflict.  An example of this would be if the original content talks about french fries best dipped with tartar sauce while the added modification talks about the best dip for french fries being ketchup.  In this case, the user will be prompted to either choose one or the other or to rephrase the modification to be more in line with the original content.  After conflict resolution is complete, NexPost.ai will generate a new post that conveys the same meaning as the original post but with the desired modification.
        <h4>Priority 2</h4>
        The reason this is second is because this step requires a bit more effort from the user and we want to offer the lowest barrier of entry solution first.  This can be viewed as a feature-add later.

      <summary class="collapsible-title">Dependencies</summary>
        In a rarity, there really is not much that the MVP of this product is dependent on besides the LLM it needs to
        do the generation. It relies on the user to copy/paste the material so there are no APIs it needs to rely on
        being supported. Besides the usual infrastructure staying alive, it is self-contained.
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary class="collapsible-title">Risks and Mitigation</summary>
        <h3>Inconsistent settings and message</h3>
        Given there are custom settings such as Writing Tone where it can range from Professional or Helpful to
        Humorous or Persuasive, the user may accidentally set the wrong tone for the generated content, especially
        if the user did not read it enough or it is written in a language they are not proficient in.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Mitigation</i>
            <br />
            While the user is ultimately responsible for the generated content, one thing that we can do is ask in
            the prompt to detect the writing tone of the original content and defaulty select that tone for the
            newly generated content. Before generation, we can still offer a way for the user to change the tone if
            they wish so we do not rip control from them.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Detection of sarcasm</h3>
        Considering the expected low bar of effort from the user or possibly the language the original content was
        written in may not be one of the user's proficient languages, the user may not be able to detect sarcasm in
        the original content. Currently, LLMs are not consistent in detecting sarcasm. This may lead to generated
        content that puts the user in a poor light.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Mitigation</i>
            <br />
            We can try to have the prompt edited so that it tries to detect sarcasm but this may not work given the
            current performance of the LLM. In addition to the attempt at sarcasm detection, we can ask the LLM
            given the user's historical post and social media content, is what was generated consistent with the
            user's message or beneficial to their cause.

        <h3>Primary Metrics for Activation and Retention</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Daily Active Users</i><br />
            We are expecting more users to use this as it is lowest cost of entry.
            <ul>
              <li>
                For the purposes of this study, we can set this to be 5% growth rate per month.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Day over Day Retention rate</i><br />
            We want to measure this day over day as we expect users to be posting on social media 7 days of the week.
            <ul>
              <li>
                For the purposes of this case study, we can set this target to be > 30%. We can adjust this as we start
                seeing more data.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Secondary Metrics</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Usage Frequency</i><br />
            This will help us know if we even have an audience or not.
            <ul>
              <li>
                For the purposes of this case study, we can set this target to be > 1 per day. 1 per day seems to fit a
                nice quota to stay on people's radar but this is something we should certainly look at in the future,
                especially when compared to usage of the other generation types.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Frequency of use for the same source material</i><br />
            We would want this to be as low as possible as that would indicate the user is satisfied with the first
            generation and does not need to keep going back to the same source material.
            <ul>
              <li>
                For the purposes of this case study, we can set this to be < 3 times at the 50th percentile mark. </li>

          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Week over Week Retention rate</i><br />
            This will let us know if users, after they have had time to digest their results and how useful the tool is,
            comes back for more.
            <ul>
              <li>
                For the purposes of this case study, we can set this to be > 75%.

    <details>
      <summary class="collapsible-title">Future Roadmap</summary>

        <h3>Content parsing from link</h3>
        Instead of having the user copy and paste the content, they can share a link to the post. NexPost.ai will then
        extract the content and generate an inspired post based on that.

        <h3>Content generation from image and video</h3>
        Instead of just being able to generate content from text, NexPost.ai can also generate content from images and
        videos. This is especially useful for platforms like Instagram where the image is the main content and YouTube
        where the videos is the main content.

        <h3>Content based on a topic</h3>
        Instead of generating a post based on another post but also not the current method of topic + thoughts from the
        author, NexPost allows creation of a content based on topic alone. This is especially useful for users that may
        not have a specific post in mind but have a general idea of what they want to post about.

        <h3>Unprompted Topic Generation</h3>
        Instead of the user discovering a topic to speak about, NexPost.ai goes and searches online the most talked
        about topics in either the user's area of expertise, what resonates with their existing audience, or what is
        trending with an audience group they wish to capture.

        <h3>Top post gatherer</h3>
        Upon given a topic, Nexpost.ai will scour the internet and gather the highest trending posts about that topic.
        The user can then select one of these posts to be the source of inspiration for their new post.

        <h3>Auto-consume</h3>
        Upon given a list of social media channels, NexPost.ai will automatically grab the ones that it feels are
        relevant and onbrand for the user and automatically repost it in the style of the user's voice.<br />
        <br />
        Similarly, NexPost.ai can be configured to watch for white papers or news articles in the user's field and
