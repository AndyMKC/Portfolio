      Time is precious and parents want to spend as much quality time with their children as possible. Reading to one's
      children is an age-old tradition that serves as a primary mean of helping the parent bond with their children and
      teaching the children the language skills they need to succeed later in life.

        <summary class="collapsible-title">Overview</summary>
        StorySpark is an AI-driven assistant that helps you keep the reading fresh for the reading parent and relevant
        to the interests of the listening child. From the family's massive collection of books, it suggests ones that
        will be fun to read for all. No more reading the same books over and over. No more tracking whose turn it is to
        select a book to read or show signs of favoritism. StorySpark takes care of it all.

        <summary class="collapsible-title">Context and Background</summary>
        In this day and age, children are often being taught visually by what's on a screen, leading them to be addicted
        to screens, deficient in literacy, and lacking imagination. Parents want to read to their children and often
        collect a mountain of books intending to do so but the quantity of books does not translate to the quality of
        time
        had by both the parent and the child. This is causing parents to offer a child screen time to entertain and keep
        them busy and "learn" but what happens is they become addicted to screens, deficient in literacy, and lacking in
        imagination.<br />
        <br />
        In terms of competition, the only competitor is an app call MoBoo. It is an app that is still being updated
        (last
        update is 2025-05-08 as of 2025-09-03). It tracks children and gives suggestions based on a pre-selected set of
        tags (for example, there is "transportation" but no "cars" nor "trains" and there is no "brand-name" characters
        from media like Moana). It hooks into Project Gutenberg for free eBooks straight from the shelf. Also,
        suggestions
        seem to work on only one child at a time as opposed to multiple. Lastly, their interface is a bunch of
        checkboxes
        as opposed to natural language, making it less ideal to interact with.
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary class="collapsible-title">Problem Statement</summary>
        <h3>Current State</h3>
        Parents treasure their sprawling home libraries but spend excessive time choosing what to read next. This often
        leads to repeating the same favorite books, disputes over whose turn it is to pick, and frustrated kids who lose
        interest—and ultimately ask for a tablet for screen time.
        <h3>Desired Outcome</h3>
        Families need an effortless way to surface under-read titles from their own collections—tailored to each child’s
        evolving interests and fair to every sibling—so reading time stays fresh, fun, and focused on bonding rather
        than
        logistics.
        <h3>Gap & Impact</h3>
        Existing apps like MoBoo rely on rigid tag checkboxes and serve only one child at a time, and lacks the freedom
        offered via an agentic AI interface. As a result, parents default back to screens, fueling literacy gaps and
        stifling imagination
        <h3>Full Statement</h3>
        Despite owning hundreds of children’s books, families lack an intuitive, AI-driven system that recommends fresh,
        interest-aligned reads from their own shelves, supports multiple children fairly, and uses natural-language
        interaction. Without such a solution, parents revert to screen-based distractions, undermining storytime’s
        bonding
        and literacy benefits—and leaving children less prepared for future success.

        <summary class="collapsible-title">Goal</summary>
        We are building a 0-1 here so the main goal is to find product-market fit.
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary class="collapsible-title">Constraints</summary>
        Since we are suggesting books for children to listen to, the product must only suggest books that are
        appropriate
        for the audience. If there are multiple listeners, it has to cater to the lowest aged child. However, if the
        lowest age child is a baby and does not understand the content of the books, then it should use the lowest aged
        toddler.

        Also, the library must not be static. Books are bought/received and donated away regularly.
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary class="collapsible-title">Customer segmentations</summary>
        There are several customer segments we want to target
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Family with children that want to be read to close in age.</i><br />
            This is a family where the children are at most 3 years apart between the oldest and youngest.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Family with children that want to be read to further in age.</i><br />
            This is a family where the children are at least 3 years apart between the oldest and youngest.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Setting where there are lots of children of the same age.</i><br />
            This could be a classroom or reading session at the park.
          </li>
        </ul>
        The simplest case is where there is a family with children that are close in age. The issue with age difference
        may require different focus as the older child may want to read along, slowing down the pace and requiring a
        simpler book whereas the younger children want to be read to and need to keep their attention span engaged. With
        a
        large number of children in a similar age, the chances their interest varies widely and a much lower chance of a
        book being found that matches.

            As an adult, I want to spend more time relaxing and bonding with my children by reading to them and not

            cognitive load figuring out what to read and dreading the boredom that comes with an oft-read book.
          </li>
          <li>
            As a child, I want to read something that I like and not let my other siblings get to choose what book gets

        <summary class="collapsible-title">Use Cases and Pain Points</summary>
        <h3>Book Reading</h3>
        The adult and children are trying to find a book to read together.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Pain Point -- Book freshness</i><br />
            The adult wants to read to the children but it is hard to maintain interest or show enthusiasm as the
            adult is getting bored of the book since they have read it many times before recently.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Pain Point -- Irrelevant interests</i><br />
            The children wants to be read a book but they have their specific interests they want to listen to and the
            book is not relevant to them.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Book Inventory</h3>
        The adult is trying to figure out what books to buy or what books to give away.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Pain Point</i><br />
            The adult has a hard time keeping track of which books contains which materials or whether they have
            duplicates of the same book since there is just so many. They may want to stock up on some books that
            cater more to the current interests of the children or get rid of books for subjects that already have a
            lot of coverage.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary class="collapsible-title">Prioritized Solutions</summary>
        Given the use cases and pain points, the solutions in a priority order are:
        <h3>Book Reading</h3>
        The product will suggest 1-3 books based on the last read dates and the subject it covers.
        <h4>Priority 1</h4>
        The reason this is first is because this is the main problem of the customer and is in need more
        frequently.
        <h3>Book Inventory</h3>
        The product will identify:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Books that are very similar to others. It will try to reduce the number of books so that it either covers
            a wide variety of subjects. An example of this would be a transportation book that may cover cars, trains,
            plans, bridge, etc).
          </li>
          <li>
            Book that covers a specific subject with great depth and is not covered by other books. An example would
            be a book that stars a specific character from a different media franchise.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Priority 2</h2>
          The reason this is second is because this scenario is once in a while and is never an immediate problem.
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary class="collapsible-title">Dependencies</summary>

        <h3>OpenLibrary API</h3>
        This is the API that allows us to get the list of subjects a book covers. If this goes down, we lose one
        critical source of information.
        <h3>Internet Archive API</h3>
        This is the API that allows us to get the synopsis of a book. From there, we can extract subjects it covers. If
        this goes down, we lose one critical source of information.
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary class="collapsible-title">Risks and Mitigation</summary>
        <h3>Rate throttling</h3>
        Especially during the initial inventory load, we may get rate throttled while trying to retrieve our
        information.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Mitigation</i>
            <br />
            The process has to have a backoff mechanism. Better still if we can understand the rate throttling limits
            and code that in.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary class="collapsible-title">Metrics for Success</summary>
        <h3>Primary Metrics to measure product-fit</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Week over Week retention</i>
            <br />
            Reading to a child is someting that happens all the time (hopefully). We should understand whether this
            tool is something that was useful enough that the adult keeps using it consistently.
            <ul>
              <li>
                For the purposes of this case study, we can set this target to be > 70%. If the user has already done
                the work to inventory their book library and they don't consistently use it, then we are not creating
                the correct solution.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Net Promoter Score</i>
            <br />
            We are theorizing that parents love to share their techniques and tricks for easier parenting with their
            social circle. Therefore, we will use NPS to understand how much people love our product.
            <ul>
              <li>
                As a MVP product, we are looking for a target NPS of 30.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Secondary Metrics</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Time to First Value</i>
            <br />
            This would mean the user has inventoried several books and is now trying a suggestion for the first time.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Considering our MVP has manual book entry, for the first version, we should aim for TTFV to be less
                than 10 minutes.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary class="collapsible-title">Future Roadmap</summary>

        <h3>Easier library import</h3>
        Currently, the user has to type in the title and author of the book which is a cumbersome and time-intensive
        task.
        A solution to this is to have the adult take a picture of the book and have OCR or AI's image recognition to
        recognize what book it is and match it. Another solution would be to keep an inventory of books and allow
        auto-complete and visual aid to assist in the input.

        <h3>Book covers</h3>
        Show a picture of the book to make it more visually appealing and easier to identify and find.

        <h3>Read along for reading comprehension</h3>
        The product should have a mode where instead of the adult reading to the children, it is the adult reading along
        with the child. Then it should be able to learn the reading level of the child. The product can detect the voice
        signature of the adult and the child and understand where the child has difficulties. The suggestion of books it
        makes will also take into account the reading level of the child.

        <h3>Reader app</h3>
        As an alternative to having the person fetch the book, it can download a pre-purchased digital book or provide
        an
        option to purchase a book. Then it can highlight words as the book is read along.

        <h3>Integration with a library account</h3>
        If there is no good suggested book in the family's inventory, this can search the local library for a book/eBook
        that is available for borrowing.

        <h3>Different language support</h3>
        Currently, we are looking only for English text when deciding what topics a book is associated with. This means
        queries in another language may fail. We should see how we can incorporate mixing multiple languages.

        Normally, projects simply bundle a full ML runtime (PyTorch, transformers, tokenizers, etc) into the application
        container so the model can be loaded locally, but that inflates the image size and therefore the artifact
        registry cost. My priority for this was to keep costs down while still maintaining performance. Instead, I
        export the embedding model to ONNX and publish the artifacts into Google Cloud Storage. To keep startup
        performance fast, I had to avoid downloading the model artifacts each time. To solve this, I am using Google's
        Cloud Function (2nd gen)'s feature to mount a Cloud Storage bucket as a local file system via FUSE. The result
        of this along with other space saving techniques managed to downsize my image from over 1 GB (at one point it
        got so big GitHub's CI/CD machines <a href="https://github.com/AndyMKC/Portfolio/actions/runs/19625426124"
          target="_blank">ran out of space</a>) to less than 90 MB. This pipeline builds the model artifacts and pushes
        it up to Cloud Storage.

        This CI/CD "pipeline" was ran from my local dev box instead from GitHub Actions. It is meant to bootstrap a

        started.

        <summary class="collapsible-title">How things work</summary>
        <h3>Offline</h3>
        As part of the CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions, we run python code load the model from Hugging Face as a PyTorch model along with its tokenizer.  We use ONNX to serialize the ONNX model (graph and weights), the tokenizer files, and the supporting config files needed to run inference later without PyTorch.  This is in an effort to keep my container image small and avoid needed PyTorch during runtime.  The model artifacts are then uploaded to Gogole Cloud Storage.
        <h3>Per Call</h3>
        We are hosting our APIs in Google Cloud Functions as serverless compute.  Upon starting up, it mounts the Google Cloud Storage that contains the model artifacts via Cloud Storage Fuse.
        
        When new books are added, it retrieves metadata about the book from various locations such as <a>Open Library</a>.  Embeddings are then generated for each of the metadata strings that the book is associated with and stored into SQL tables inside Google BigQuery.
        
        When the user asks for a recommendation to a book similar to their query text, it generates embeddings from their query text, filters the results to the set of books that they own, and then calculates the cosine similarity between the metadata text and the query text.  For now, the highest similarity score of each metadata text per book is kept and returned (within the limit of a certain number of books).  The user (or in the future, the agent!) can decide which book to read based on the "freshness" (how long ago it was read) and the similarity score.

      <summary class="collapsible-title">Things I am learning</summary>
      For this project, while delivering a working solution is important, the biggest value I want to deliver is delivering myself.  I intentionally stepped outside of my comfort zone doing something that I am not as familiar with to make sure I keep those brain muscles fit and improving.  This includes:
      <h3>Google Cloud Platform</h3>
      I have always used Microsoft Azure professionally but with this project, I conscientiously chose to step outside my comfort zone.  As with other tools and technologies that I had to adopt for this project that I never used before, everything seems so familiar while still foreign.  The problems I encountered and solutions I applied in my professional life were similar to the ones I faced here except that I am using different branded tools and I have to use them a slightly different way.  Azure has Blob Storage containers and Google has Cloud Storage buckets.  Azure has Azure Functions and Google has Cloud Run.  Azure has Synapse and Google has BigQuery.  While they are not exactly the same, the years of experience in Azure has really helped adopt using GCP quite smoothly (and I would suspect AWS).
      <h3>ONNX and PyTorch</h3>
      I have to create embeddings for the metadata so I chose a model from Hugging Face and loaded it up as a PyTorch model.  To minimize the image size, I serialized the model artifacts using ONNX and used the ONNX runtime to execute the model.  These are two technologies that I have only read about so it was really great to get to use it in practice and see the fruits of my work in action.
      <h3>FastAPI</h3>
      I needed a way to expose my APIs that is fast, cheap, and convenient.  Working professionally, I have always worked in an environment where this has been set up and I only needed to "edit" to add more functionality instead of starting one from the beginning so this is quite the experience.  I looked into popular alternatives such as Django and Flask but settled on FastAPI as it was simple to start and learn, fast and efficient, has type checking, and comes with a free swagger page for easy testing.  There are other benefits I am keen to explore (native support for WebSockets and built in utilities for OAuth2) so this area is very exciting to me!
      <h3>GitHub Actions</h3>
      Besides using GitHub as a code repository, I am also using GitHub Actions for CI/CD and their secrets/variables vault to keep the code configurable and safe.  I was very keen to get this part (and the Terraform part) correct as I want to avoid having to pay the constant overhead tax of managing this incorrectly each time I have to do a deployment.  Additionally, I am using GitHub Pages to host the website that you are reading on right now!
      <h3>Terraform</h3>
      When I started this project, I did not envision spending a lot of time doing IaC but this is an example of being able and willing to wear many hats in order to do what is right.  I wanted a full production project that others can clone and learn from so it was important to have all the benefits of IaC.  I would say most of my conversations with AI has been discussing how to get this part correct.  In the end, having Terraform set up to configure all the cloud resources has paid off as I continually change the configurations of my cloud assets to keep up with my needs and I am glad I am able to add another tool to my toolbox.
      <h3>Docker</h3>
      I have used Docker before but this project gave me the opportunity to not just refresh this skill but also learn new things.  The biggest challenge was to decrease the image size and I had to iterate a lot to whittle things down for the production image while still keeping the development image debuggable in VS Code.  I especially liked learning about distroless images and how small they were.  Seeing the size improvements (discussed in the CI/CD part of Implementation) going down with each change was quite an emotional ride as some changes had drastic size reductions (looking at you PyTorch) and some things actually went up in size (thankfully never more half a megabyte).
      <h3>Product-oriented thinking</h3>
      This was the first step to all this and the result is what you read above.  I wanted to act on this StorySpark idea not just from the point of a developer.  The saying goes to walk in the shoes of your customers to completely understand their experience and deliver solutions that meet their needs.  I want to extend this and walk in the shoes of the product managers in order to help me become a better teammate to them.
