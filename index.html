      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="preserve-lines">I am a collaborative, upbeat leader with hands-on product management experience. I’m now eager to bring this blend of expertise and people leadership to a full-time product leadership role.

My last several years working in the Windows Data organization and engaging with product teams to help them extract, understand, and make decisions based on data coming from over 1.4 billion Windows devices has made me realize that my true passion is connecting with customers. Being able to truly understand and empathize their business needs and working with the engineering team to devise solutions in a timely manner that enables their successful outcomes is what drives me forward.

These experiences have been immensely fulfilling, and I’m excited for what’s next. At the end of the day, nothing makes me happier than seeing our customers succeed and our engineering teams smile.

This website will be a portfolio of case studies from a non-coding perspective.</p>
