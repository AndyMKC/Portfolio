      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="preserve-lines">I am a collaborative, upbeat engineering leader with hands-on experience doing building software, building data pipelines, build MLOps platforms, doing product management work, and  building testing frameworks. I’m now eager to bring this blend of expertise and people leadership to a full-time engineering leadership role.

My last several years working in the Windows Data organization leading teams and connecting with customers to help them extract, understand, and make decisions based on data coming from over 1.4 billion Windows devices has made me realize that my true passion is serving two audience groups:  my customers and my engineering team.  Being able to deliver solutions to our customers that shifts the needle in terms of helping them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome-Driven_Innovation" target="_blank">do their job</a> while keeping my engineering team happy and productive is extremely fulfilling and is what drives me forward.  At the end of the day, nothing makes me happier than seeing our customers succeed and our engineering teams smile.

This website will be a portfolio of case studies from a non-coding perspective.</p>
